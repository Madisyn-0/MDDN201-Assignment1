									<h2><a href="#">Concept</a></h2>
									<p>An interactive resource that allows people to discover different coding languages and connect with others to build upon their basic skills. The website will display a range of main coding languages and outline their main uses and where they can be applied. To further people’s knowledge of the languages, there will be an online text editor that allows you to interact with others and work on small projects together with basic templates provided. While there are a number of websites out there that teach people how to code, my aim is to create a collaborative online space for people to use as a beginning guide to the languages. This will take shape in the form of small topics that people can choose from to work on in a small group. I aim to broaden people’s scope of knowledge surrounding programming and learn a little bit about how applications or services, that they may use every day, are run.</p>

									<h2>Target Audience</h2>
									<p>My target audience is young adults from around the age of 18 to 26. I chose this age range as I wanted to capture people who are at an age where the internet and online services or applications make up a huge part of their life. I want to capture their interest in how coding may work and explain it in an easy to understand and simple way. This age range also captures people who may be interested in starting to learn a coding language but are unsure of where to start and what the differences between the main languages are. However, as my project will be a website, it will be accessible to anyone on the internet which broadens my audience significantly. To engage with the varying audiences, I aim to create a fun and interactive space that encourages creativity, teamwork and perseverance for all. </p>
